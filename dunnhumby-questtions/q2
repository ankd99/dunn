ques2) How would you find the system load? If you have high load, does it mean that the CPU
is completely busy? Why? / Why not?

# system load can be checked with TOP command, by obsering load average. 
Also htop command to check load on the individual cores of system.

If we have 4 core machine, then load can go upto 4 and we can say system is running at the maximum i.e. 400%

If load increases now, the new process will go to the queue.
