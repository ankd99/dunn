ques1) i) TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 80. Sending cookies.
Check SNMP counters.
ii) TCP: time wait bucket table overflow.
iii) [93511.248912] Out of socket memory

i) Reason: Application has high load with many frequent TCP connections made. Flood of traffic to the server leading to
dropp of tcp connections.

Resolution:
1. First we need to determine if the traffic is valid or malicous to the server. This can be done by using any of the network
monitoring tools - wireshark, tcpdump.
2. If found malicous - block traffic via ip tables rule or via cloud provider firewall.
how to determine this ? - check how much traffic was expected?, client ip addresses and their expected behaiour.

If traffic is valid and huge and accepting application is accptin traffic slowly, though slowly.
we can increase socket backlog(of underlying system) which is 128 by default.

we faced a similar issue we increased backlog to 1024. we used strace command to see that it was only accepting 128 packets.

sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=1024
to make changes permamnent - echo "net.core.somaxconn = 1024" >> /etc/sysctl.conf

#confirm changes by viewing again
sysctl net.core.somaxconn

ii) # time wait bucket table overflow error - As per my understanding this error occurs due to increase in number of time wait connections.
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse - enable this

TIME_WAIT - when a tcp conn closes, port doesnt gets closed immediately after, os has to wait for duration of timewait.

The socket is waiting after close to handle packets still in the network. time wait tells us that this side connection has been closed.
connection is still kept around so any delayed packets can be handled.

solutions -

a) We should use connection pooling. not to make a new connection on every request.

b) increase port range
echo 15000 65000 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range

c) Increase the availability by decreasing the FIN timeout.
echo 30 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout (default is 60)
/etc/sysctl.conf - add here

d) enable tcp_tw_reuse. set its value to 1
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_reuse

tcp_tw_reuse - Allow to reuse TIME_WAIT sockets for new connections when it is safe from protocol viewpoint.

iii) [93511.248912] Out of socket memory

# how much memory the kernel is configured to dedicate to TCP run:
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem

when max no. of pages allowed for queuing connections by all tcp sockets exceed the max memory limit, kernel starts throwing
"out of socket memory"

# how much memory is being used by sockets in system at present:
cat /proc/net/sockstat

--
other reason which may cause the above error " out of socket memory" can be because of no. of orphan socket.
orphan sockets as well consume memory, precisely 64k.

# command to check max no. of orphan sockets.
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_orphans

#command to check existing no. of orphan sockets present in the system.
cat /proc/net/sockstat

resolution - if existing orphan socket is more than max, we can simply increase max count in the file.

I expect this issue to be interlinked with the TIME_wAIT issue. So we need to check on that too and probably enable tcp_tw_reuse.
